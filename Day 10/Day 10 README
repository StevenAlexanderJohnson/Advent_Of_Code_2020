For day ten part two I played around with BFS and DFS. The working C++ file that holds the Pt 2 code is the Test.cpp. The issue with C++ for this one is that the number returned
is so large that it it overflows the unsigned long long data type so it is impossible to display in C++. To see the answer look at Day10Pt2.py.
